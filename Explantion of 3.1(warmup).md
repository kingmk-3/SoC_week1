# `3.1:First, a bit of warm-up(Explanation)`

You can't use any command(as far as I know) because of path expansion(see reference of week 2). Even if you try using the normal GUI of OS to create a folder/file, the GUI will show that the job is done. But when you open the terminal and run ls to verify, you will see another character instead of "/" (like we used "&"(pathi in place of path) in the next parts of the question). For example, In the case of macOs, we see ":" instead. And it also works the other way around, that is, you name a file/directory with the name having ":"(or respective character) using the command in line, then the macOs(or your OS) will show "/" instead. Try this out, it will give a hint how everything in your normal GUI works more or less like non-automated basic file manager that you were required to make.
